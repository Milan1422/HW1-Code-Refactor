# HW1-Code-Refactor

## What was week one homework about?
Week one homeworok was about taking pre-existing code for Horiseon website and making it more accessible without changing it's layout. Also to try and leave the code cleaner than what it was.

## What did I do to make this happen?
I first started by making the code more accessible by replacing divs with semantic elements. Also adding alt attributes to images to help with accessibility. After, I focused on comments and indentation to make the code be some what more readeable. Then I continued onto the css file and made adjustments so that the code wouldn'd be dry. As well as adding comments so it would be more on par with the layout of the html file.

## What did I get out of this assigment?
I feel that this homework made me have a deeper understanding of the little knowledge I had about html and css in general. I got comfortable with making code pretty and easy to read for it to be easier to work on. I got to familiarize myself with more elements that I didn't know and actually understand their use. Aside from the files themselves my use of the terminal improved significantly by constant usage. However, this assigment has made me realize that I have to work more on my commits as I don't make them as often as I should. But I do understand the importance of early and often commiting!
